1.) download GCR over here: https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/619/, then use it to open up an existing ISO of UP training mode. make sure it's the most recent version
2.) right click on the "root" directory in the right pane of GCR, export it somewhere
3.) clone the UPTM repository and make your changes
4.) run the .bat script in "Build TM Codeset"
5.) take everything in the Additional Files directory and put it into the unpacked ISO. Shouldn't need Start.dol cuz we're using a TM iso already. 
6.) inside the patch directory, run the build.bat for each folder you made changes in, copy the .dat files of each output folder to the "TM" folder in the unpacked ISO
7.) using GCR, rebuild an ISO from the unpacked ISO directory (Root -> Open, Root -> Save, Rebuild) 
i've only done this two times so i'm hoping i got everything right here lol
for testing, i just changed the title of an event. haven't really done anything beyond that right now
